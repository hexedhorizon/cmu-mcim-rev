         College Overview
      </div>

        <span class="location">
           <p class="location">The College of Arts and Sciences became 45 years old on June 2010. Established as a service college on 1965 with the elevation of the former Mindanao Agricultural College (MAC) to Central Mindanao University (CMU) by virtue to RA 4498, the college started with only two departments: Humanities and the Natural Sciences, each one having two or more divisions. In the 1980’s up to the present, CAS metamorphosed into Physics, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Behavioural Sciences, Language and literature, Biology and Chemistry from two degree programs in 1971- Bachelor of Arts major in English and Bachelor of Liberal Studies- the college now offers nine undergraduate degree programs (AB English, AB Psychology, AB Sociology, AB History, BS Biology, BS Chemistry, and BS Mathematics), four Master’s Degree Programs (MA Anthropology, MA English, MA Mathematics, and MS Biology). Along with the increase in the degree programs is the change of the CAS building from basically a one-storey building in 1965 to a three-storey building in 1980.
          </p>
           <p class="location">In 2005, a new two-storey building was added and in 2009, another one-storey building with five classroom conducive for learning to the infrastructure of the CAS. There are men and women, who have graduated from the college and who are now responsible and productive members of the society, are but indicators that the college has done its share to make CMU achieve its mission, vision, goals, and objectives.
