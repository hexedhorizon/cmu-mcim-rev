         College Overview
      </div>
        <span class="location">
          <p class="location">The College of Agriculture is the premier college of Central Mindanao University. It has its origin in Mailag, Malaybalay, Bukidnon as the Mailag Industrial School (MIS) in 1910 as one of the settlement farm schools organized by the Americans. It offered only the first four grades of the elementary agriculture curriculum. The school was opened largely to address the necessity of training Bukidnon to teach in their own province since it is difficult to hire non-Bukidnon teachers to serve in newly-opened public schools. It underwent seven name changes to fully reflect its aspirations and stay dynamic as an academic institution. It became Bukidnon Agricultural School (BAS) and was transferred to Managok, Malaybalay, Bukidnon in 1921. In 1923, it became Bukidnon Rural High School (BRHS) and in 1928, it was renamed the Bukidnon Agricultural High School (BAHS). In 1938, it became Bukidnon National Agricultural School (BNAS). Its operations were stopped due to the outbreak of war in 1944. However, in 1946, BNAS was re-opened and its present site in Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon.</p>
