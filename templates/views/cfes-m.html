         College Overview
      </div>
        <span class="location">
          <p class="location">Before it became a separate and full-pledged academic unit in the University, the College of Forestry started as a department of the College of Agriculture of CMU in 1963. In September 13, 1967, the College of Forestry was established by virtue of BOR resolution no. 78 and consequently became independent from the College of Agriculture. It started offering a baccalaureate program in Forestry and Certificate of the Forest Ranger. Since then, the college underwent regular revision of the BSF curriculum have been made in response to the ever-changing demand and relevance of the times as well as in compliance with the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE), Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities (AACCUP), Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). In like manner, the 2-year certificate in Forest Ranger (CFR) also underwent changes over time, from the terminal course in 1967 to the ladderized curriculum in 1994. But CFR later on was abolished due to dwindling demand for the program.</p>

         <p class="location">In 1982, in coordination with the Graduate School, the College of Forestry offered a graduate program with majors in Forestry Resource Management and Forest Biological Sciences. The Master of Science in Forestry, major in Wood Science and Technology, was offered in 1996. It was in 1996 that the College in collaboration with other colleges in the University drafted with curriculum for the four-year Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (BSES) program as mandated by CHED. Eventually, the program was first offered in June 1997.</p>

         <p class="location">The College was mandated in 1980 to create a unit which would be tasked to sustainably mange the forest resources of the University. Consequently, the Forest Research and Resources Development Center (FRRDC) was established. This unit takes charge of the production, management and development of the CMU forest reservation and, at the same time, supports the instruction and research functions of the College. It has continued to operate as a separate unit of the College but was renamed in 1996 as the Forest Resources Development Program (FRDP). At present, it is named Forest Resources Development Division (FRDD) under the Business Management and Resources Development Office (BMRDO) of the University. However, it is now directly under the supervision of the Office of the University President and not anymore of the College of Forestry as it used to be.</p>

         <p class="location">Through the years, the College has already produced a significant number of professional foresters wherein some even were topnotchers in the forester’s licensure examination. These forestry graduates have been employed in different government offices mostly in DENR, and in private agencies, both local and abroad. Some of them are occupying key positions, while others venture into teaching, consultancy and entrepreneurship, among others. On the other hand, BSES program of the College has likewise produced graduates who are now employed mostly in DENR, LGUs, and NGOs.</p>
