         "loc_history":"Before it became a separate and full-pledged academic unit in the University, the College of Forestry started as a department of the College of Agriculture of CMU in 1963. In September 13, 1967, the College of Forestry was established by virtue of BOR resolution no. 78 and consequently became independent from the College of Agriculture.

Since then, the college underwent regular revision of the BSF curriculum have been made in response to the ever-changing demand and relevance of the times as well as in compliance with the recommendation of the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE), Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities (AACCUP), Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). In like manner, the 2-year certificate in Forest Ranger (CFR) also underwent changes over time, from the terminal course in 1967 to the ladderized curriculum in 1994. But CFR later on was abolished due to dwindling demand for the program.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, in coordination with the Graduate School, the College of Forestry offered a graduate program with majors in Forestry Resource Management and Forest Biological Sciences. The Master of Science in Forestry, major in Wood Science and Technology, was offered in 1996. It was in 1996 that the College in collaboration with other colleges in the University drafted with curriculum for the four-year Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (BSES) program as mandated by CHED. Eventually, the program was first offered in June 1997.\r\n\r\nThe College was mandated in 1980 to create a unit which would be tasked to sustainably mange the forest resources of the University.
